# MetaTrader Terminal Archive

This repository serves as a dumping ground/archive for official MetaTrader 3, 4, and 5 terminal.exe files. It contains previous versions of the official builds for historical and reference purposes.

## About

MetaTrader periodically enforces minimum required versions for its terminals, making older versions obsolete and preventing them from connecting to the trading servers. This archive preserves these older versions for posterity and research.

## Minimum Required Versions

| MetaTrader Version | Minimum Required Version |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| **MetaTrader 3**  | End of Life              |
| **MetaTrader 4**  | 1420                     |
| **MetaTrader 5**  | 4410                     |

> **Last bump:** December 1, 2024

We predict that MetaQuotes will bump the minimum required versions in the coming months, as they have historically done at regular intervals.

## Latest News

- **Upcoming Changes:** Based on past trends, we anticipate another version bump in the near future. Stay tuned for updates.
